#### **Plotting the Q Husimi quasiprobability distribution for different quantum states**
***
#### **Abstract** 
Based on a homework assignment from MIT's course 8.422 Atomic and Optical Physics ll, imparted by Professor  Wolfgang Ketterle we plot the Q Husimi quasiprobability distribution for different quantum states
#### Dependencies
- Julia 1.1.0
- PyPlot
#### Jupyter Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook (Julia 1.1.0 Kernel) is added to illustrate the workflow. 
- There is a script `Q_Husimi_Functions.ipynb` in which we plot the Q Husimi quasiprobability distributions for quantum states

More details about the work can be found in the written thesis `thesis.pdf`
